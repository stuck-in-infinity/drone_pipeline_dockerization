"""Per-project artifact storage layout.

Maps the pipeline's hard-coded ``Config`` directories onto a single isolated
tree per project so concurrent jobs never collide. Local filesystem for now;
swap the body of these helpers for an S3/MinIO backend later without touching
the rest of the app.

**Run versioning.** Inputs (the uploaded ortho + ground truth) are shared across
runs and live at the project level. The derived/compute directories are scoped
to a *run*, under ``work/run_<n>/...``. Re-running with new parameters (see
``PATCH /projects/{id}``) bumps ``project.current_run`` and computes into a fresh
``run_<n+1>`` folder, so previous runs are preserved on disk rather than wiped.
