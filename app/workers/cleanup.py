"""Periodic retention cleanup.

A Celery Beat task deletes projects whose last activity (``updated_at``) is older
than ``settings.retention_days`` — removing both the database row and the
project's storage folder. It:

  * skips projects that are currently running (ANALYZING / FINALIZING),
  * is guarded by a Redis lock so two beat ticks / workers can't overlap,
  * also sweeps *orphan* folders on disk (a project folder with no DB row whose
    last modification is older than the cutoff), in case the DB and disk drift.

Schedule and registration live in app/workers/celery_app.py.
